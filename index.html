    <h2>Weekly H</h2>
    <br>
    <p>This week, we learned more about the usage and functionality of JavaScript. And I feel very interesting when watching other studentsâ€™ works. Everyone's ideas are interesting and novel. I am deeply inspired.</p>

    <p>This semester is coming to an end. Life this semester has been very challenging for me and also made me very tired. I took five lab classes this semester. They are Internet art, ceramics, new media robots, animation and 3D modeling. There's no denying that they're all very interesting and useful. I enjoy being able to master so many different skills. But the final assignments for these five courses started almost at the same time, which made me dizzy. Every assignment takes a lot of time and effort. I lost a lot of downtime. This made my mental state very tired. And the deadlines for these assignments are all on the same day. During this time, I was very busy trying to complete these assignments. But I believe I can overcome this. After getting through this period, you can relax for a few days. I am looking forward to the next holiday life.</p>

    <p>Since the performance of my previous laptop is no longer sufficient to meet my study needs, after all, it has been with me for six years. So I bought a brand new laptop. The arrival of the new computer made me feel very happy and temporarily washed away my fatigue. This notebook is equipped with the latest generation 4070 graphics card, 13th i7 processor, and has 32GB of memory. Even the screen is 2k quality and has a high refresh rate. It can fully meet my learning and gaming needs. It's even more powerful than my desktop computer at home. I've only had that desktop computer for about a year.</p>
